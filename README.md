## Mock up

[the W.](https://thunderous-selkie-c74591.netlify.app) was built using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Future Concepts

Adding my customized icons that are more specific to types of descriptions. I would also like to add in autopcomplete and hope to implement that soon. Adding more widgets, such as a calculator or calender would really round out the website. I did implement Spotify on an earlier run but there we some complications that I have to look into to see why there is a problem.I also want to speerate the data between the API calls and the rendering of the page
